## Description

This project aims to evaluate the availability of desks and rooms at IADE - School of Design, Technology, and Communication. We monitor the real-time presence of individuals in a room using ultrasonic sensors placed under the desks to assess the variation in the positions of the elements. This technology allows us to distinguish between the presence or absence of people. The project is being developed as part of a master's program, with the assistance of several Information Engineering students, and is currently in the experimental stage.

## Overview

The web interface facilitates interaction with sensors located across various university sites. Sensor data is collected and stored in a MongoDB database hosted on macOS. The website processes this data to provide users with valuable insights and a user-friendly interface for monitoring and analyzing sensor readings.

## Technologies

- **Flutter:** Framework used for developing the web interface.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database used for storing sensor data.
- **Raspberry Pi:** The server to host your sensor and deploy. 

## Features
- Real-time visualization of sensor data.
- Historical data analysis and reporting.
- User-friendly interface for monitoring sensor readings.
