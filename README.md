# University Sensor Web Interface

This project aims to create a web interface for communicating with sensors deployed at a university. It is currently in an experimental stage.

## Overview

The web interface facilitates interaction with sensors located across various university sites. Sensor data is collected and stored in a MongoDB database hosted on macOS. The website processes this data to provide users with valuable insights and a user-friendly interface for monitoring and analyzing sensor readings.

## Project Partnership

This project is a collaboration with the IADE - Creating Creators university for a master's project.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter:** Framework used for developing the web interface.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database used for storing sensor data.
- **macOS:** Operating system hosting the MongoDB database.

## Features

- Real-time visualization of sensor data.
- Historical data analysis and reporting.
- User-friendly interface for monitoring sensor readings.
